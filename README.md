# RAG-Document-Q-A-chatbot
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for document-based question answering (Q&amp;A) using LangChain, Ollama, and FAISS. Users can upload research papers (PDFs), which are processed into vector embeddings, enabling an AI model to retrieve relevant content and generate accurate responses.
